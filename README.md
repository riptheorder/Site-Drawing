# Site-Drawing

Site drawing, from GPS tracking to architecture” or “for a located digital practice” is a technological methodology for spatial design. The practice is based on a GPS receiver fixed to a telescopic stick tracking the movement of the participant within a site. Like a pen on a paper, the movements are recorded in 3 dimensions to be able to design the spatial project with centimeter accuracy. Digital design is based solely on a simulation created by satellite views, cadastral plans or other data extraction. By performing the design in situ, the model is accurate and site specific, canceling the need for a simulation.
